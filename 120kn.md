# 120kn 
finally happy indian aviation finally took a leap 
we are finally building stuff

## kaveri?
gtre's efforts did payed off . kaveri and kabini core gave us expertise 


## now all we need is -
1. high alt testbed
2. flying testbed
3. ground test facilities

### gtre had to pay a lot of money to the russian institute of flight tests ( gromov flight research institute) 
now we are independent ( hope so ) maybe we'll get new facilities for all kinds of tests required and even il76 ( de- comissioned from the air-force ) .
